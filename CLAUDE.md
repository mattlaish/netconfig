\# Claude Project Instructions



At the beginning of work:



1\. Read README.md to understand the product.

2\. Read AGENTS.md and follow its permanent development rules.

3\. Read AI\_HANDOFF.md for the current project state and next task.

4\. Read patch.md for the chronological patch/version ledger.



Keep changes focused and run relevant tests.



Update AI\_HANDOFF.md after meaningful development work.

Update patch.md after meaningful development work and before handover.

After completing a development stage or updating README/handover/version
documents, make the final line of the user feedback the current Taiwan time in
this exact format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC+8 (Taiwan)`.



For local/terminal sessions:

\- The user handles git pull, git add, git commit, and git push manually.

\- Follow AGENTS.md as the authority for whether any Git operation is allowed.



For Claude Code Web/cloud sessions:

\- Use the normal isolated branch / pull-request workflow.

\- Never merge directly into main without user approval.
